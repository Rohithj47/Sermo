<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Sermo is an AI-powered intelligent report generation tool. It uses audio recordings from different stages of surgeries to generate impactful, summarized reports. It also allows using keywords to search and filter the documents based on need.
*    Critical information, such as anomalies discussed verbally or additional tools required during surgery, can be extracted and documented from simple audio recordings.
*    Medical professionals can compile a comprehensive collection of reports as a valuable reference in the future for similar cases and prepare for surgeries.
