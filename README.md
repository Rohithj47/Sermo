    Sermo is an AI-powered intelligent report generation tool. It uses audio recordings from different stages of surgeries to generate impactful, summarized reports. It also allows using keywords to search and filter the documents based on need.

## About The Project

<img src="https://github.com/rahuls98/Sermo/blob/main/screenshots/3.jpeg" alt="Logo" width="160" height="260">

Sermo is an AI-powered intelligent report generation and visualization tool. Using Sermo, a medical staff has to simply record any informal conversation they have with the patient ands hit submit. Our backend will generate queryable and impactuful reports that will serve as actionable and insightful information for future use. Using the power of Machine Leanring & TextRank algorithms, the search functionality in Sermo will display only the most relevant and helpful reports that will aid surgeons(or medical professionals) in their upcoming operations.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
### Installation

Currently the backend is hosted on an EC2 instance and therefore needs no setup.

The mobile client can be downloaded on an Android device by using the APK.
<br />
<a href="https://github.com/rahuls98/Sermo/blob/main/mobile-client/app/release/app-release.apk">
  Download app-release.apk
</a>

The credentials needed to login:
Username: test@gmail.com
Password: test123

Once this is entered on the mobile app, a user can then create new reports by uploading recordings or search existing reports using the search functionality.

<!-- FUTURE WORK -->
## Future Work

- We will leverage the data in Sermo to fine train the Machine Learning models, in order for better performance in the future. 
- We hope to make Sermo cross-platfrom and support iOS and the web as well.
